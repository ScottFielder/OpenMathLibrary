/// For example A dot B = |A|*|B|*cos(theta) which gives us information about the angle between two vectors
/// But now we can dot lines and points together too! This is going to be fun
/// Usually a dot product returns just a number right? Well, in GA its a bit different
/// If the two things you are dotting are the same type (line or point) you do get a scalar
/// But if the things are different, it reduces the highest grade by 1
/// Amazingly the new lines are orthogonal & through the original point we were dotting
